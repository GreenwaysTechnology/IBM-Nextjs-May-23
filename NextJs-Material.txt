What is a Next?
 Next is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.

Web Applications:
.................

What is web app?
  Type of distributed app,deployed at server , accessed over network(internet) vi various network protocals like http,tcp,smtp...
  
  Web apps works based on request and response model.
  Web apps are hosted on server called web server.

Web server receives request , runs a program, that program returns response to the client.

Reponse would be document.
=>HTML
 
other reponses types
XML,JSON,Documents,images,vidoes.........

What is web and why it was created?

  Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.

The first Web browser is line mode web browser,launched in 1992.

The first web server is NeXT computer

The first web page , lanuched http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html


Types of Web application:

1.Static web applications - 1989 to 1995 (Now a days also people are building this type apps)
   Hard coded html pages , prepared html pages  kept at webserver , the webserver will send those html pages to clients(browsers)

2.Dynamic Content generation application(1996 to till date)
  After 1995, many people thought that how we can use web for biz information system
 how to share biz informations via internet.
 Generally biz data is stored in databases , how to embed data base data into html pages

 1.web server need to talk to database
 2.web server need to prepare html pages based on database records
 3.Those information must be transported to web clients

Web server core design to get client request and send html response to the client.

Along with web server, something was introduced called "Programming language runtime"

The first run time was created based on "c" language called "CGI-comman Gate way interface" later instead of c language "PERL" language.

3.Web services-1998 to till date
 Rise of ECommerce, using internet and web how to exchange data between two biz organizations.
 The existing html technology was not suitable to send and recive data because html is just user interface document language.
 We need to data to be exechanged, thats where new data model was created called 'XML'
xml based web apps called web services.

soap protocal was created to transfer XML based documents "SOAP based webservices"

After 2005 soap based web services, started failing due to mobile computing.

New Web services  were designed called "RestFull Web services"

Restfull web services were used to build any type of data formats like json,xml,pdf,html etc...


4.Client side web apps called "Single Page Web Apps"(2007 to till date)

Single page web apps are built using javascript at client side where as server side web services(REST apis) are used.

SPA Tech stack:
HTML 5,CSS 3, Javascript.
Frameworks build based on SPA

1.Angular js
2.react
3.vue js
.....................................................................................
			  React as SPA lib
.....................................................................................

Reactjs was created by facebook , in order to build SPA applications for browsers.

Advantages of SPA:
1.Pages are created  at client side, so server load is completly removed
2.SPA reduces the lot of phsyical pages after deployment.
3.Clear separations of concerns.

Drawbacks of SPA:
.................

Pure client SPAs are problematic when the app is senstive to SEO and time-to concept
This is because the browser will recive a large empty HTML page and has to wait until the javascript is loaded before rendering any thing.

The brith of new Technology called  "SSR" -  Server Side Rendering:
..................................................................................
 I need SEO but at the same time, i want to use SPA as well.

We provides first class api to "render"  an SPA app into HTML strings on the server.
This allows server to send back already rendered HTML, allowing end users to see the content immediately while the javascript is being downloaded.

This process is called "hydration", the app is compiled at server side and sent to the client which will be  interactive.

SSR types:
 =>Partil SSR 
     We have SPA already, but only few pages(index.html) page is pre compiled at server and sent to client , from where client apps(spa) starts working.

Generally React has api called "ReactDOMServer" using this api we have to render html page on node js(express/hapi)
 
 =>Full SSR
     Every thing is compiled at server side , where as client logics like api calls using ajax is done at client side once the app is rendered.

=>Full Stack apps: =>Full SSR(Next.js)
   Using react like apps are built using full stack apps=>Next js

Next js Arch with respect to SSR

SSG/JAMStack: (Static Site Generation)
............

What is Jamstack?
Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.

Jamstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience.

Just sending HTML pages to the client without preparing htmls pages while requesting.

SSR will prepare html at server side during "request-response  phase/cycle"

Server side rendering can be done "ahead of time"-->SSG.This means we can pre render an entire application into HTML and serve them as static files.
This improves site performance and makes deployment a lot simpiler we no longer need to dynamically render pages on request.
.....................................................................................
			   Next js  -SSR and SSG
.....................................................................................

Next js is full stack web framwork built on the top of react core features  to build modern SSG and SSR apps at very fast...

Next js uses "rust based build system" where as react uses web pack build ....
.....................................................................................
			 Basic building block of Next js(Web apps)
.....................................................................................
1.page
2.Routing
3.Data Fetching
4.Rendering - Client side rendering(traditional ajax) + server side rendering
6.Styling
7.Type script is another language of choice building strongly typed server side apps
8.API Develovement
...................................................................................
			 Next app setup 
....................................................................................

Next app technologies:

1.React
  It is free and opensource front-end javascript lib for building user interfaces

2.Turbopack
   An intcremental bundler optimized for javascript and typescript written in Rust and built into Next js

3.Speedy web compiler
   A Extensible to Rust based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools, and can be used for both compilation and bundling.

4.Vercel platform
   Vercel is the company who created next js, they are providing a platform to deploy applications in cloud, server less env.

.....................................................................................

			 Root File/Root Component
.....................................................................................

In react , there is index.html which is built in read made file, inside that file only we create DOM tree and we insert

index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="Web site created using create-react-app"
    />
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
    <!--
      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
    -->
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root">
      
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

here div element is root container element.inside we create DOM tree and insert which is called SPA
  HTML elements are created at client only.

Where as SSR , index.html and other html files are created server side.

How to create index.html in Next app?

 Next provides a root Component called "RootLayout"
// import './globals.css'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

// export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
//   return (
//     <html lang="en">
//       <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
//     </html>
//   )
// }
export default function RootLayout(props) {
  return <html lang="en">
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome to Next app</h1>
    </body>
  </html>
}

Here the component name can be any thing "RootLayout" or "MyLayout" "AppLayout"
but the next is going to identify the root component based on file names


Arrow functions:
const RootLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return <html lang="en">
    <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
  </html>
}
export default RootLayout;

			 React Foundation for Next Js
....................................................................................

React is based on Component driven Architecture.

What is Component?
 Component is object.
 Since Component is object we can reuse.
 Component represents a User interface.

There two types of components

1.client side components
  Components are used in the single page webs 
2.server side components
  Components are used in the server side.

Server and clients components allow developers to build apps that span the server and client ,coimbining the rich interactivity of client side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering.


Thinking in Server Components:
..............................

React was created for building SPAs.
but how react changed the way we think about building UI,React server components  introduce new mental model for building hybrid apps that leverage the server and client.

=>Instead of React rendering your whole app client-side(such as in the case of Single Page applications).
 React now gives you the flexibility to choose where to render your components based on "their purpose"

Why server Components?
......................

1.Performance:
1.1. Server components allow developers to better leverage server infrastructure. for      eg large dependencies that previously would impact the javascript bundle size on      the client can instead remain entirely on the server.

1.2.They make write a react apps feels similar like jsp and servers,aspx,php or ruby on   rails but the power and flexibility of react and the components model for   templating UI

1.3.When server components the inital page load is faster,client side javascript bundle is reduced.

1.4.We can able caching 

1.5.if you want add client side interactivity we can use "client components"

2.Progressive:
...............
1.When a route(index page) is loaded with Next.js, the inital HTML is rendered on the server.
2.The HTML is then progressively enchanced in the browser, allowing the client to take over the application and add interactivity.

.....................................................................................
				Client Components
.....................................................................................
Client components enable you to add interactivity in the client side to your application.

"In Next.js" they are pre-rendered on the server and hydrated on the client.

You are creating a component , how to say this component is client side and server side..

export default function Greeting(props){
	
	return <>
		<h1>Hello Next</h1>
             <>

}

How to define that the above code, must be executed in the server or client

'use client'  // "use Client" directive

export default function Greeting(props){
	
	return <>
		<h1>Hello Next</h1>
             <>

}
.....................................................................................
  	When to use server side component and when to use client side component
.....................................................................................

what do you need?                         Server    client 
					component  component

1.Fetch data                               yes       no

2.Access back resources(directly)          yes       no

3.Keep security related info(api keys)     yes       no


4.large bundle dependencies/reduce client
  js                                       yes       no

5.Add interactivity and event listeners    no        yes

6.Use state and life cycles hooks          no        yes

7.Use browser only api(storage)            no        yes

8.Custom hooks that depend on state,effects
  browser apis                             no        yes

9.if you write "class components"          no        yes


Patterns:
........
1.Moving clients components to the leaves(tree):
..............................................

if you want to improve perfomance and also add strong security we recommend moving client components to the leaves of your component tree where ever possible.

if you have layout having static data  like logo,links and an interactive search bar that uses state.

Instead of making the whole layout a client component, move the interactive log to client component eg <SearchBar/> and keep your layout as Server component.

2.Composing Client and Server components:
..........................................

Server and clients components can be coimbed in the same component tree.

Process behind server and client components:
............................................

=>On the server, React renders all Server components before sending the result to the client
   =>This includes server components nested inside client components
   =>What if the client components are encounted in this stage, it will be skipped.

=>On the client, React renders Client Components and slots in the rendered result of server Compoents
   =>if any server components are nested inside a client,their rendered content will placed correctly the client component during client compoenent rendering

In Next js, during the inital page load, both the rendered result of server components from the above step and client components are pre-rendered on the server as plain html to produce a faster initall page load.
.....................................................................................

"Recommended Pattern: Passing Server components to client components as prop"
.....................................................................................
			  Pages & Routing
.....................................................................................

The core of next apps are routing.
The skeleton of every app is routing.

Pages:
......
  A page is UI that is unique to a route.
  You can define pages by exporting a component from page.js file to make the route   publicly accessible
  
Create first Page by adding a page.js file inside app directory. 

By default routing is enabled,automatically, unlike react spas you dont need to specify the routing.

Note: in next js you dont need to configure any routers, routers are mapped against files

http://localhost:3000/  =>Root URL(route) => page.js

  By default root path is mapped against page.js

src/app/page.js

export default function HomePage() {
    return <h1>
        Hello,Welcome to Next js
    </h1>
}

app/page.js  ----> /

How to define new route and render accordingly?

app/about/page.js   => /about
   
export default function About(){
    return <h1>About us</h1>
}

app/dashboard/page.js  ====> /dashboard


export default function DashBoard() {
    return <h1>Dashboard</h1>
}

app/dashboard/settings/page.js     ===> http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings
....................................................................................
			Routing core concepts
....................................................................................

Inside the app directory, folders are used to define routes.

Each folder represents a "route segment" that maps to a "URL" segment. To create nested route, you can nest folders inside each other.

	localhost:3000 /     dashboard /settings
		       |        |          |
		 Root segment  Segment     leaf Segment

How to create segments(eiether root/segement/leaf)?
  A special file called page.js to make route segments publicly accessible.

if you different name other than page.js , it will not be avaible for public access.

 app/dashboard/config/myconfig.js

http://localhost:3000/dashboard/config/myconfig
.....................................................................................
			   Creating UI
.....................................................................................

Special file conventions are used to create UI for each route segment.

File convention
pages -  page.js
layouts - layout.js
routes   - route.js - server side end points
templates  - template.js
loading   ----loading.js
errors    -----error.js,global-error.js,not-found.js 
..............................................................................
Roles of Folders and files:
..........................

1.folder are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the hierarchy from the the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a page.js file

2.Files are used to create UI that is shown the route segment
....................................................................................

page.js :  create the unique UI of a route and make the path publicly accessible
  -route.js : create server side apis/endpoints for a route

layout.js:
  Create shared UI for a segement and its children.
  A layout wraps a page or child segement.
 -template.js
     Similar to layout.js execpt  a new component instance is mounted on navigation.
loading.js
   To show progress bar while loading ui, it uses reac Suspense boundary.
 
error.js
  to handle ui errors,internally it uses error boundary
  ->global-errors.js 
      catching errors in the layout layer level
  ->not-found.js
        this is shown when if there is no url segment matches...
